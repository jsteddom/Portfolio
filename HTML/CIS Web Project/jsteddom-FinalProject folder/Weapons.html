	<h2> Overview </h2>
        <p class="biggerFont">
			<span class="EFT">Escape From Tarkov</span> has many available weapons in the game to choose from. Not only that, there are loads of 
            various attachments and weapons parts to create all sorts of weapons. This page is an overview of the styles of arms available in the game.
		</p>
    
        <h2> Pistols </h2>
        <p class="biggerFont"> 
            Pistols in Escape From Tarkov are often used the most by beginners. 
            They are the cheapest weapons to buy which makes them also safe to bring in if you die since it is cheap to replace. 
            They can be equipped to the holster sections on your character in the inventory tab.
            However, they are the weakest guns to use due to the ammunition that they use is not strong compared to that of rifles and snipers. 
        </p>
        <h2> Assault Rifles </h2>
        <p class="biggerFont">
            Assault Rifles are most commonly used among all players. Not too expensive to buy and not too expensive to customize a little bit. 
            They use good ammunition and can be commonly found in raid. 
            Most assault rifles can be set to fully automatic and single fire with some of these allowing burst fire. 
        </p>
        <h2> Shotguns </h2>
        <p class="biggerFont">
            Shotguns in Escape From Tarkov are unlike shotguns in other games. 
            They have a lot more range in this game, allowing them to be more useful as a weapon. 
            However, that does not mean they have range comparable to Assault rifles, but have more range than 2 feet in front of you like most games.
            Most shotgun ammo has little to no armor penetration and lots of flesh damage. 
            Aim for limbs and the face.
        </p>
        <h2> Sub-machine Guns </h2>
        <p class="biggerFont">
            Sub-machine guns are cheap and shoot fast.
            They have the highest fire in their class but use ammunition that pistols use. 
            They do not have the greatest damage but are reliably cheap and require little to no modification to have great recoil control.
            These are beginner friendly guns as well as fun to use for more experienced players.
        </p>
        <h2> Snipers </h2>
        <p class="biggerFont">
            Snipers have the heaviest hitting ammunition in the game but most come in a bolt action platform which makes them difficult to use in close range.
            Their ammunition is quite expensive and so is attachments like optics and silencers. 
            Most powerful weapons in the game but the most expensive.
        </p>
        <h2> Marksman Rifles </h2>
        <p class="biggerFont">
            Marksman rifles are a mix of snipers and assult rifles. 
            Usually in the form of semi-automatic platforms. 
            They have a wide variety of ammunition and parts allowing for beginners to make budget weapons and more experienced players to create lethal and reliable weapons.
