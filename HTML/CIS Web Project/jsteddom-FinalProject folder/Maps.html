		<h2> Maps </h2>
		<p class="biggerFont">
			<span class="EFT">Escape From Tarkov</span> currently has 9 playable maps in the game
		</p>
	<ul class="biggerFont">
		<li> Factory </li>
		<li> Customs</li>
		<li> Woods </li>
		<li> Interchange</li>
		<li> Shorline </li>
		<li> Reserve </li>
		<li> Lighthouse </li>
		<li> The Lab </li>
        <li> Streets of Tarkov</li>
	</ul>
        <p class="biggerFont"> Each of these maps have their own levels of loot (how valuebale and how much), their own level of difficulty which is based on how hard it is to extract and fight, and their own "flow" 
            Provided below will be a basic rundown of each map, providing the most important information
        </p>

		<h2> Factory </h2>
		<p class="biggerFont"> Factory is the smallest map in the game. 
            It only can spawn 4 to 6 players in a given match.
            The main way players tend to make money off going to factory is PVP.
            Taking down other players and taking their gear out of raid for profit. 
            Players also like to look the office area as it has some high tier loot such as the safe on the third floor.
            Unless you have the Factory exit key, there is only one extration point at gate 3. 
            Having this key makes surviving on factory much easier becuase players like to camp the gate 3 extract.
        </p>
        <h2> Customs </h2>
		<p class="biggerFont"> Customs is the map every player should learn and master first. 
            Its layout allows you the choice of going head into fights and contested areas or going to non hotspots, safely loot, and extract
            The extractions you will get will be on the opposite side of the map from where you spawn. 
            The main areas of the map are the red warehouse (Big red), the dorms (2 and 3 story dorms), the stronghold, and crackhouse. 
            These areas have the best loot on the map and are highly contested.
            The previously mentioned factory exit key can also be used for an extract on this map at the stronghold. 
            The power must be turned on.
        </p>
        <h2> Woods </h2>
		<p class="biggerFont"> Woods is map that does not have a lot of buildings and structures. 
            It's mainly covered in trees, bushes and rocks.
            The only big areas on the map are the sawmill and camp near the UN roadblock. 
            Woods does not have a lot of loot but the quality of loot of greater than other maps which makes up for the lack of valubles. 
        </p>
        <h2> Interchange </h2>
		<p class="biggerFont"> Interchange is a giant shopping mall and there is loot everywhere. It does not matter where you go in the mall, you will find valuables everywhere.
            What cab make this map frustrating for a lot of new players is the flow of the map.
            Most maps have a flow to them so when you learn all of the spawns and hot spots, you can know where you are generally safe and when you should habe your guard up.
            Interchange has no flow. 
            The routes and positioning of players on this map can be completely random because there is no "place-to-be" on this map because loot is everywhere.

        </p>
        <h2> Shorline </h2>
		<p class="biggerFont"> Shorline is considered the worst map in the game. 
            Like interchange, there is not much of a flow to the map but that is not always the case.
            Shorline does have it's hotspots such as the resort, the cottages, and the pier.
            However, these are the only places that really have any loot. 
            The rest of the map space is either trees or locations that have little loot. 
            The best way to survive is to avoid the resort and when moving through the middle of the map, move quickly. 
        </p>
        <h2> Reserve </h2>
		<p class="biggerFont"> Reserve is like interchange, having loot everywhere on the map. 
            Unlike interchange though, it has a flow that allows players to know where to go to play safe and where to go to fight.
            Reserve has the most difficult extractions which require some work from the player. 
            Some of these are turning on the power for the bunker but you have a limited time to extract, requiring the player to wait almost the whole raid timer to extract on the train, 
            or an easy extract but you cannot take a backpack.
        </p>
        <h2> Lighthouse </h2>
		<p class="biggerFont"> Lighthouse is an interesting map and it is snipers paradise.
            If you do not run weapon with a medium to long range scope, you are putting yourself at a big disatvantage. 
            The reason being the long range fights you likely encounter as well as fighting the AI player known as the Rogues at the water treatment plant
            The Rogues still have ridiously good aim and can kill you almost instantly if you are not prepared. 
            This map has easier extracts than others and a lot of them as well.
        </p>
        <h2> The Lab </h2>
		<p class="biggerFont"> The Lab (Labs) has the best loot hands down.
            You can loot this map with no keys and make the most amount of money out of any other map. 
            However, before you can even load into the map, you must have a labs access key card which are very expensive. 
            Becuase of the steep price of the access card, not many players are willing to go or unable to play on the map.
        </p>
        <h2> Streets of Tarkov </h2>
		<p class="biggerFont"> Streets of Tarkov is the newest and biggest map in the game currently and considred to be the best map. 
            It has loot everywhere yet a readable flow to the map. 
            It can have up to almost 20 player in a raid which can make for some very PVP intensive raids. 
            It is a great map to learn as a beginner as well.
            What makes this map unplayable for some people is the bad optimization of the map. 
            Many players experience huge fps drops when playing this map since it is still fairly new. 
            It is likely that the average player cannot run this map at a playable fps. 
        </p>
