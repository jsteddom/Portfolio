        <h2> How To Do Quests </h2>
        <p class="biggerFont">
            <span class="EFT">Escape From Tarkov</span> has many different quests you can work on for the traders. 
            Quests are some sort of mission from the traders that require one or more of the following:
            <ul class="quests">
                <li> Eliminating Scavs </li>
                <li> Eliminating Players </li>
                <li> Surviving a raid </li>
                <li> Turning in barter items </li>
                <li> Turning in other items (Weapons, money, etc.)</li>
                <li> Turning in quest items</li>
                <li> Going to locations </li>
                <li> Planting special gear </li>
            </ul>

            
        </p>
        <p class="biggerFont">
            To know if you have a quest available, go to the tasks tab on a traders page. 
        </p>
        <img src="questing.png" alt="questing" class="center">
        <p class="biggerFont"> 
            Here you can click accpet and begin the task. You then will read what the quest is and you now are prepared to complete it.
            Any quests that require you to look for "quest items" (items that only spawn when you have the quest available), it is recommeneded you 
            look for a youtube video to find out where it is. 
            This is because the descriptions of the quest from traders tell you the general location but not specifically where. 
            Some of the quest items are flash drives which are very small, easy to miss and with the most recent update have multiple spawns. 
        </p>
        <img src="questComplete.png" alt="complete" class="center">
        <p class="biggerFont">
            One you have fulfilled all of the requirements for a quest, the trader you completed it for will have a blue check mark on there icon. 
            This indicates you have completed everything for a task.
            Click complete and your a finished. They will send you your rewards and you can move on to other quests.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p class="biggerFont">
            Keep the following in mind while questing:
            <ul class="quests">
                <li> If you die with quest items, you will have to go back and get them again </li>
                <li> Many quests are level locked or locked behind completing other quests </li>
                <li> Many quests require keys to open doors to rooms, look carefully in the description for these details</li>
                <li> Most barter items you have to turn must have the found in raid status </li>
            </ul>
