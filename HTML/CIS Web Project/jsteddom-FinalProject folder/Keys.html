        <h2> Keys </h2>
        <p class="biggerFont">
            Another unique feature about <span class="EFT">Escape From Tarkov</span> are the numerous keys to explore locked areas across all the maps.
            While there is loot you can find all over the maps without keys, the rooms you can unlock rooms that spawn better loot, potentialy 10 times the worth of other things you could have found. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In order to get keys you must search jackets or loot scavs for them. Most of them you can buy on the flea market once you are level 15.
        </p>

        <h2> Tips </h2>
        <p class="biggerFont">
            <ul class="biggerFont">
                <li> Not all maps have an equal amount of rooms to unlock. The above picture shows the woods, facotry, and interchange do not have a lot of rooms to loot. Kep this in mind when packing your secure container for a raid </li>
                <li> Keys have at most 40 uses, some having as little as 1. Usually you won't have to worry about the 40 use keys unless you play a lot. </li>
                <li> A lot of keys are required for quests, so try to hoard as much as you can in the early game to be prepared for those quests. </li>
                <li> Not all keys are equal, some keys open rooms with amazing loot and some open rooms that have nothing in them </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2> Where to learn Keys </h2>
        <p class="biggerFont"> 
            There are hundreds of keys in the game which can make it difficult to keep track of what keys are good or bad and what keys have what kind of loot. Below is a video from a channel that makes
            great and short guides on keys, the location of the room they unlock, and what spawns inside of them.
