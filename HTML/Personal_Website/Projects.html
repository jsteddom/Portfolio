        Project: Custom Website (solo)
    </h2>
    <p>
        In CIS 300 (Web Design and Development), the class project was to create our own website that would feature <br>
        everything we have learned in the course such as CSS styling and website design and organization. I created  <br>
        my website based on a game I play called "Escape From Tarkov". This website is a beginner's resource to the <br>
        game, providing important information to new players to help the overcome a steep learning curve.

    <h2>
        Compiler Program
    </h2>
    <p>
        My last project in CSE 340 (Principles of Programming) was to create a program that would read in a text file which <br>
        would contain a C++ program and compile the code. Using linked list and vectors, I created a program that could <br>
        compile C++ programs that contained simple math operations, IF statements, FOR loops, WHILE loops, and SWITCH cases <br>
