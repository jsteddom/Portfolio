        I am a computer science major at Arizona State Univeristy. I will be graduating this May of 2025 and pursuing a master's in computer science.
        I have a passion for programming and I have enjoyed various type of programming from front-end Development like swift UI and HTML to
        back-end development like C++, Python, and more. My studies at ASU have inspiried me to work hard and even develop my own projects
        that I would like to turn into fully functional programs that I can publish
