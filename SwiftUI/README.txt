This section of my portfolio is my work using SwiftUI in Xocde (Mac)

This folder will be divided into two categories: Projects and Exercises & Demos

Projects:
	This will consist of large Xcode projects with complex applications. 
	For example, one project here will be my Final project for my 
	CSE 335 Mobile App Development Class. 

Exercise & Demos:
	This will consist of smaller Xcode projects/files. Some of theses will 
	be small exercise similar class assingments and some 'demo' projects
	whose purpose is to learn/develop certain features/functionalities
	in an issoldated file for future reference.
