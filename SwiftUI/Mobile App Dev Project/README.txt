This is the (solo) project I submitted for my mobile app development class. The class project was to develop an application that we come up with ourselves that would meet the following criteria:
	- MVVM architecture
	- Persistant data storage
	- Use a table view
	- Integrate some map functionality
	- Use an API call

MY PROJECT

My application is "Collector's Hub". This applications purpose is to allow users to keep a log of items they collect. I was inspired to make this since I collect various things like cards, figures, etc.

FUNCTIONALITIES

The application allows for users to create an account and that information will be stored even when the application is stopped and started again. Once a user is logged in, they will be presented with the Home Screen which will display a Pinterest style photo gallery. The gallery is of all the items the user has added to this digital collection. Selecting a photo will bring the user to a different view where they can view a bigger version of the item image and details they have added to the item.

In the home view, the user can select 4 buttons: add, delete, search, and map. The add button will allow users to add an item. The user will enter the following: Name, info (description), price, select a type, upload a photo, select a date they acquired it, where it was acquired. 

Users can delete items by selecting the trash can button. They enter the name of the item they would like to delete and then select delete.

The cabinet button will take users to a search view. Users will enter in keywords for a search and search results via an API call will be displayed. The search is specifically used to get display ideas for their collectables. The API call is a custom google search.

Finally the map button. Users are presented with two search bars. One that will change the location and one for entering keywords to search for nearby locations that will sell these items. 

TESTING

If you would like to try this yourself, you can! If you have a MAC, this files in here can simply be downloaded and ran in Xcode. 

IMPROVEMENTS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

There are improvements I can make for the application.
	- Photo size consistency. If users upload photos of different resolutions, the home view will look a little uneven.  
	- UI design. Although it is presentable, I did not style it much with colors, fonts, etc. I would like to make it more visually appealing.
	- Removing features. The map and API call features were required for the project. However, I do not think these are features anyone would use for an app dedicated to logging collectables. 
	- Adding features. I would like to add a graph feature that would help users visualize how much they are spending and how often. I would also like to add some sort of "News" page. It would display relevant news to collectors like conventions coming up, price updates, etc.


This is one of my favorite projects I have worked on. I really enjoyed developing this application and have found motivation to continue development and releasing this on the App Store someday.
