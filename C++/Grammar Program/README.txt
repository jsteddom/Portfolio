This is the second project in my Principles of Programming Languages class.

In this program, we were tasked with creating a program to analyze a "grammar" like the following: (This is a simple grammar)

	A -> B
	B -> C
	C -> D

Functions:
	- Functions to parse through the grammar for anaylsis
	- Print all terminals and non-terminals (a, A)
	- Remove all the useless rules from the grammar
	- Calculate all the 'first' sets
	- Calculate all the 'follow' sets
	- Determine if the grammar has a predictive parser
