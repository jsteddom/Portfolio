This project was the third and final project for my Principles of Programming Languages class. 

In this program, we were tasked to create a parser function that would take a text file as input. Inside the text file would be a C++ program. The parser would take this input and output a linked list which would correctly handle each line of code in order to get the output of the text file code. 

The programs in the text files would be math equations with varying complexity code-wise.

The parser is capable of parsing programs with Math operations, IF ELSE statements, FOR loops, WHILE loops, and SWITCH statements. 

The given code to handle our parser program is copyrighted and cannot be uploaded.
