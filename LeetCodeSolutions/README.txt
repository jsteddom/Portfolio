The purpose of this folder is to store all my current and in-progress solutions to Leet Code problems.

In each file, I will have the solution and some additional code to run and display the answer (Leet Code just wants the functions). 

Additionally, I will also have other commented solutions. These solutions that are commented out will be slower solutions that worked to solve the problem. The non-commented solution will be a faster solution I have come up.

The point of this is to see where my thought process went originally and compare to a more optimal solution.
